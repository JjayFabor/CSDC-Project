Website and Desktop Application for Onlince Crime Reporting System for Barangay

The website application is designed for users or residents of the barangay who want to report incidents
or complaints. Users can fill out a form with information such as the type of incident, description, date
and time of the incident. The system will then store this information in a database, along with the status
of the report (open or closed).

The desktop application is designed for local authorities to access and manage the reports submitted by
the users through the website application. This application provides an interface for local authorities to
view and update the status of the reports. They can see which reports are open and which are closed.


Some of the key features of this system are:
      • Analytics and Reporting: Both the website and desktop application have analytics and reporting
           features. This allows users to see statistics on the types of incidents reported, trends in crime,
           and other key metrics that can help local authorities make informed decisions and allocate
           resources.
      • Community Safety: Both the website and desktop application also have community safety
          features. The website has a safety guide section where users can find safety tips and resources.
          The desktop application includes an emergency alert notification to promote overall safety in
          the barangay.
